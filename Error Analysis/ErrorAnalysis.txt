TOP Document	:	8421223	Studies have shown that low vitamin D levels cause hair loss. Too much vitamin D: High levels of vitamin D can also cause hair loss, which is why it is important to have the right balance. Iron deficiency: Iron is important for your hair, nails, and skin. Too little can cause hair to fall out or make the hair follicles smaller so your hair strands end up being thinner. Calcium deficiency: Calcium is also important for your hair, and if you are not getting enough vitamin D (which is needed for absorbing calcium), your hair may fall out. Stress: Stress causes hair loss.

Calcium deficiency: Calcium is also important for your hair, and if you are not getting enough vitamin D (which is needed for absorbing calcium), your hair may fall out. Stress: Stress causes hair loss. This is widely known, and seeing your hair fall out can just add to that stress! It takes from 1 - 4 months after a stressful incident for the hair to start falling out. Lack of sleep: If you are not sleeping well, this can also have a negative effect on your hair. The type of shampoo you use: Shampoo may also be making your hair fall out. Natural shampoos are much better for your hair and scalp than chemically-based ones. Food allergies: Various food allergies, especially to dairy, can cause your hair to fall out."}

There are many types of B vitamins, but the ones that are most beneficial for hair loss are B12 and Inositol. B12 is found in hair itself, so if your body is deficient in it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see why your hair could stop growing or even fall out. Many people, especially vegetarians, are deficient in vitamin B12, as it is most commonly found in eggs and meat."}
